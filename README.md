# Basic Image Recognition

<img src = "./assets/cover_base_1000x500.png"/>

The goal of this program is to begin to use machine learning, in the form of pattern recognition, to be used in a near future developing a multimodality of image program.

In this case, we'll use numbers,  to simplify our first approach.

The more complex the image, the more complex the code will need to become.

When it comes to letters and characters, it is relatively simplistic, however.
